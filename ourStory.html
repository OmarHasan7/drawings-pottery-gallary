                    <p>        <span>It's all started</span> when I began to get my artwork out
  there. I was only doing canvas artwork at the time. Like
  most young artists I was keeping my work to myself.</p><br>
                    <p>        Then slowly started to share. The reaction I got was
  amazing overwhelmingly positive And there was also
  a demand on buying the drawings. so I did that for
  a little bit.</p>

                    <P>        <span>While I was continuing</span> my canvas drawing I began to
  add some decorative drawing as well, my friends told me why
  didn't I draw and put that artistic touch on other things, not
  just canvas?</p><br>
                    <p>        I liked what they said a lot and I saw the interesting ideas
  my friends had. Immediately we start working together after all
  nothing better than a group of friends working on something that
  they passionate about.</P>
